# 🎬 Movie Search & Recommendation Web App

## 🌟 Project Overview
This web application allows users to **search for movies** and view **movie details** such as the poster, release year, plot summary, and genre.  
It fetches real-time movie data by integrating with the **OMDb (Open Movie Database) API**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **API integration**, **front-end development skills**, and **dynamic data rendering** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔎 **Search Movies**: Users can search for any movie by typing keywords or exact titles.
- 🎞️ **Display Multiple Results**: Shows a list of movies related to the search keyword.
- 🖼️ **View Posters**: Displays movie posters; if not available, shows a placeholder image.
- 📝 **Movie Information**: Displays title, year of release, and optionally a plot and genre.
- ❌ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles cases like movie not found or API errors.
- 🎨 **Responsive UI**: Simple and clean layout for a good user experience.
